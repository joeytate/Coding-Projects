NBodyPlotter plots a 3-D graph of the paths of N-number of bodies in  a gravitational orbit with each other
together with the center of mass of the system.
Thee total angular momentum and energy levels of the system are also graphed on a 2-D plot versus time.

lam is an application that calculates the coordinates of N-number of bodies in an orbit over time 
and outputs the calculations in the in the initalconditions.OUT file together with the fort1XXN files. 
It was provided by Professor Ryan Russel for the ASE 366K class at UT Austin.

input.txt can be altered; Nbod can be changed to specify the number of bodies in the system,
intSeed changes the random seeding for mass and location calculations, and inttol affects the margin of error
for calculations
